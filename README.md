# Debugging software with git bisect

Simple Phoenix application to demonstrate how to use git bisect to debug
software. You can find the talk [here](https://github.com/bdubaut/talks)

## Getting started

### Minimal requirements

- elixir 1.13.1
- erlang 24.2

### Running the app

```
$> mix deps.get
```

To start the server: start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with
`iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To run the tests:

```
$> mix deps.get
```
